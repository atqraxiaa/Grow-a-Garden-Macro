- Monitor scale set to **100%** (DPI 96).
- Roblox installed and logged in.
- AutoHotkey v2.0 installed (not needed if running with compiled exe).

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place the `Lib` and `Assets` folders in the same directory as the script.
3. Adjust your settings in `config.ini` as needed.
4. Run the script `Grow a Garden Macro.ahk` with AutoHotkey v2.

If using the compiled version, required libraries and assets are automatically included.
